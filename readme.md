# No Pointer
A chrome extension for mouseless browsing.

This is by no means a finished product. 

Press `ctrl+shift+a` to show keyboard shortcuts to links. Press any of the keys on screen to go to that link.
Press `ctrl+alt+a` to show keyboard shortcuts to links. Opens in a new tab.

Press `ctrl+shift+s` to show keyboard shortcuts to inputs. Press any of the keys on screen to set focus to that input.

## Nice to haves
Fix going to next 'page' of links
Do something with selecting text on the page.
 - (Maybe find all [pre] tags, and do 'select first word', 'select sentence', 'select all' or something. Useful for copying code)
Make site specific profiles (Youtube and Gmail don't work)
Restructure to module/class/whatever
Make main keys configurable
