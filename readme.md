# No Pointer
A chrome extension for mouseless browsing.

This is by no means a finished product. 

Press `ctrl+a` to show keyboard shortcuts to links. Press any of the keys on screen to go to that link.

Press `ctrl+s` to show keyboard shortcuts to inputs. Press any of the keys on screen to set focus to that input.

## Nice to haves
Make `ctrl+[key]` work for opening in new tab. Keys should  stay visible.
Do something with selecting text on the page.
 (Maybe find all [pre] tags, and do 'select first word', 'select sentence', 'select all' or something. Useful for copying code)
Make site specific profiles 
    Like google.com should prioritize search result links over all the other stuff
    StackOverflow code boxes should be recognized
