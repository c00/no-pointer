Press `ctrl+alt+a` to show keyboard shortcuts to links. Opens in a new tab.
Press `ctrl+alt+a` again to show shortcuts to the next batch of links.

Press `ctrl+shift+s` to show keyboard shortcuts to inputs. Press any of the keys on screen to set focus to that input.

## Quirks
Selecting a select element (dropdown) doesn't 'open' it. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to do that with JS.

## Nice to haves
Handle frames
Do something with selecting text on the page.
 - (Maybe find all [pre] tags, and do 'select first word', 'select sentence', 'select all' or something. Useful for copying code)
Make site specific profiles (Youtube and Gmail don't work)
Restructure to module/class/whatever
Make main keys configurable
